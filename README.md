The connection_plus package in Flutter is used to easily detect and manage internet connectivity status across different platforms. It allows developers to check the current connection status (Wi-Fi, mobile data, or no connection) and listen for connectivity changes in real-time. This helps ensure that apps can respond dynamically to network status changes, such as by pausing data synchronization, displaying offline messages, or adjusting app functionality when the connection is lost or restored.

## Key Features:
- ### Check Current Connectivity:
Determine whether the device is connected to Wi-Fi, mobile data, or has no connection.
- ### Listen to Connectivity Changes: 
React to changes in network status dynamically, such as switching between Wi-Fi, mobile data, or losing connection.
- ### Cross-Platform:
Works on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, and macOS.
- ### Low Overhead: 
Does not require background services, ensuring low resource consumption.
- ### Customizable Responses: 
Adapt app behavior based on the network status, such as enabling or disabling specific features depending on the connection type.
